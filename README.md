## Quick note

Hello! This is my burger app, I created when learning the React course of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy ([Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)). A huge thanks to Max for creating a great course. I have learned a lot about React from nothing (maybe not nothing, I have a base foundation of React already) to hero. I'm glad to buy this course and I will move to Vue course of Max after this
